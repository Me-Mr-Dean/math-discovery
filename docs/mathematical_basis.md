# Mathematical Basis

## Overview

The Mathematical Pattern Discovery Engine uses machine learning techniques to discover patterns in mathematical sequences by extracting pure mathematical features without relying on pre-computed mathematical knowledge.

## Feature Extraction Methods

### 1. Modular Arithmetic Features

For a sequence S = [s1, s2, ..., sn], we compute:
- Residue patterns: si mod m for various moduli m
- Residue transitions: (s(i+1) - si) mod m
- Quadratic residues: si^2 mod m

### 2. Digit Pattern Analysis

- Last digit distributions
- Digit sum patterns
- Digital root sequences
- Palindromic properties

### 3. Statistical Features

- First and second differences
- Ratio analysis: s(i+1)/si
- Growth rate patterns
- Variance and standard deviation

### 4. Prime-Specific Features

- Prime gaps: p(i+1) - pi
- Twin prime indicators
- Safe prime detection
- Wilson's theorem validation

## Machine Learning Approach

The system uses ensemble methods combining:
- Random Forest for pattern classification
- Neural networks for complex pattern recognition
- Support Vector Machines for boundary detection

## Mathematical Validation

All discovered patterns are validated against:
- Known mathematical theorems
- OEIS sequence databases
- Statistical significance tests
- Cross-validation with held-out data
